# Submarine Project

Welcome to the Submarine Project repository! This project aims to design and build a remotely operated submarine for exploration and educational purposes. The submarine is controlled using Arduino microcontrollers and is equipped with various sensors for navigation and data collection.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several components:

- **Schematics:** This folder contains the schematics used for the 3D design of the submarine. These schematics provide a detailed blueprint for constructing the physical structure of the submarine.

- **Equipment List:** This folder contains a list of all the equipment needed for the project. This includes components such as motors, sensors, batteries, and other hardware required to build the submarine.

- **Arduino Code:** This file contains all the Arduino code required to control the submarine. The code is responsible for interfacing with the various sensors and actuators onboard the submarine, as well as implementing control algorithms for navigation and maneuvering.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Submarine Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/submarine-project.git
   ```

2. Review the schematics in the `schematics` folder to understand the design of the submarine.

3. Refer to the equipment list in the `equipment_list` folder to gather all the necessary components for the project.

4. Upload the Arduino code provided in the `arduino_code` file to the microcontrollers onboard the submarine.

5. Assemble the physical structure of the submarine based on the schematics and connect all the components as per the wiring diagram.

6. Test the functionality of the submarine in a controlled environment such as a pool or a tank of water.
